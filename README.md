## Project Overview:

### GovChain is a decentralized Web3 platform designed to bring full transparency to government projects. By leveraging blockchain technology, GovChain ensures that public initiatives ranging from infrastructure development to community programs are fully verifiable, auditable, and tamper-proof.

### Each project is represented as a unique NFT (ERC-721), storing essential details such as budget, timeline, location, and proposal documents (PDFs). Stakeholders and authorized approvers receive governance tokens (ERC-20) to vote on project approvals, making the process secure, immutable, and publicly accountable.

### With GovChain, citizens, auditors, and government officials can track project progress in real-time, verify funding allocations, and participate in decentralized governance, creating a transparent and trustable public project ecosystem.
